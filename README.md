# WorkSchedule
Easy way to precisely measure the time you are working as a freelancer

# Course
Free Time, did this after the third Semester to learn to code and because I needed it.
With this I went deeper into QT, C++ and XML.

# Description
Measure the time you are working from home by simply clicking start / stop. Different Users & Projects possible. Store sessions.

# Technologies
QT, XML 
(You need some extra .dlls to execute this if qt is not installed on your system but don't worry, they are not that hard to get)
